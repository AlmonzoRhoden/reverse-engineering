<h2> Descripition </h2>

Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code.

In the Develop folder, there is starter code for a project. Begin inspecting the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, in a Google Doc, write a tutorial explaining every file and its purpose. 

At the end of the tutorial, add instructions for how you could now add changes to this project.

Business Context

A link to a Google Doc or video explaining the  the Developer folder. <br>
