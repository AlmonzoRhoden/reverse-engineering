<h2> Documentation descripition </h2>

Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code.

In the Develop folder, there is starter code for a project. Begin inspecting the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, in a Google Doc, write a tutorial explaining every file and its purpose. 

At the end of the tutorial, add instructions for how you could now add changes to this project.

Business Context
When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.
